# :book: Ready - Find Awesome Books!
:closed_book: This website allows you to search for a specific genre of books and get back a list of books for that same genre, as a result.

:mag: To search for a genre, just click on the search button: this will trigger the appearance of the search bar (which you can also make disappear, by clicking on the search button again).

:eyeglasses: You can also read the book description, when available, by clicking on the "Read More" button, which also allows you to unexpand the extended card.

:game_die: The randomize button gets you a list of books from a random genre, if you don't feel like typing anything specific or just don't know which genre to search for.

:construction: It also detects if there are already some results and deletes them, in order not to create chaos on the webpage.
The website is completely responsive, too.
